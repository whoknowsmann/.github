# .github

Default community health files for the **whoknowsmann** organization.

Files in this repository are automatically used by all repos in the org that don't have their own versions.

## Contents

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Contribution guidelines, coding standards, commit conventions |

## How It Works

GitHub automatically looks for community health files in this `.github` repo when a repository doesn't have its own. This keeps standards consistent without duplicating files everywhere.

## Adding More Files

You can add any of these to extend org-wide defaults:

- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` — Community standards
- `SECURITY.md` — Security policy
- `SUPPORT.md` — How to get help
- `FUNDING.yml` — Sponsorship links
- `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` — Issue templates
- `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` — PR template
